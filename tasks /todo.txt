Subabase-->

-- Users table for authentication
users (id, email, created_at, subscription_tier)

-- Projects table for generated sites/apps
projects (id, user_id, name, description, generated_code, domain, created_at)

-- Templates table for resume-to-site conversion
templates (id, name, template_code, category)


Authentication:
* Email/password signup
* User sessions and protected routes
* User dashboard for managing projects

File Storage:
* Resume uploads (PDF, DOCX)
* Generated site assets
* User profile images
2. External API Integrations Needed
// For AI-powered code generation
const generateCode = async (prompt: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}` },
    // ... generation logic
  });
};


Domain Management API:
* For subdomain creation
* DNS management
* SSL certificate provisioning
Deployment API:
* For hosting generated sites
* CDN distribution
* Build pipeline integration
3. How to Add Backend Features
To implement the full VibeCode functionality:
1. Connect to Supabase by clicking the green Supabase button in the top-right corner
2. Add Authentication - user signup/login system
3. Create Database Tables - for storing projects and user data
4. File Upload System - for resume processing
5. AI Integration - OpenAI API for code generation
6. Deployment Pipeline - for hosting generated sites
4. Next Steps to Improve
Would you like me to help you implement any of these features? I can:
* Set up Supabase authentication and database
* Create a user dashboard for managing projects
* Add a resume upload and processing system
* Implement AI-powered code generation
* Build a project deployment system
The current landing page is a great starting point, but to make it a functional product like described, we'd need to add these backend services and integrations.
What specific functionality would you like to implement first?
